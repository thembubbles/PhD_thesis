*The magmatic-hydrothermal transition in pegmatites and its effects on rare-metal mineralization: Insights from melt-crystal-fluid interactions in phosphate minerals from the Buranga dike (Rwanda)*

The enclosed codes were used to process and plot the data acquired as part of the research of Fernando Prado Araujo towards obtaining the 
degree of Doctor of Science (PhD): Geology at the KU Leuven, Belgium.


This README file describes the codes used for processing and plotting the data from the Raman spectrometry analysis
of minerals and fluid inclusions in samples from the Buranga pegmatite, western Rwanda
