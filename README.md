## Folders are divided by analytical methods into: 
- **Raman Spectroscopy**: contains the scripts used for processing and plotting the spectroscopic measurements of minerals and fluids in the Raman microscope
- **Mineral Chemistry**: contains the scripts used for processing and plotting the chemical analyses of major and minor elements in minerals obtained with EPMA
- **Microthermometry**: contains the scripts used for processing and plotting the measurements of fluid inclusion properties in the heating-freezing stage 
- **LAICPMS**: contains the scripts used for processing and plotting the chemical analyses of major and trace elements in fluids and minerals obtained by LAICPMS
